## Design Doc

This app is all about "contributors" making payments to "creators".

Contributors can make one-time payments OR recurring payments (maybe).

Each creator gets a "landing page" describing what they do and how much you can donate.

Each landing page will be stored on the blockchain. The creator must pay a tx fee.

Clients will grab a list of all creators from the blockchain and cache them locally in localstorage.

Clients will use their metamask wallets to donate.
