## Design Doc

This app is all about "contributors" making subscription payments to "creators". A creator will be able to pay an ETH tx fee to create a landing page that contributors can donate at.

### Attributions

I used [Sergei Tikhomirov's Smart Contract](https://github.com/s-tikhomirov/pethreon) to help me with solidity.

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) is the application my dapp is modeled off.
