# Questions I had when developing the project

## Multiple testing frameworks?

I like Jest for React, but it looks like Truffle uses Mocha and Chai? I wonder if I need both?

## Does ethereum support subscriptions?

It looks like the lightning network on BTC can support subscriptions with payment channels. But it seems like all transactions on Ethereum must be initiated from an external source. I have to think about how I can create a subscription service.
