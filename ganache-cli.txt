  --keepAliveTimeout  The number of milliseconds of inactivity a server needs to wait for 
                      additional incoming data, after it has finished writing the last response, 
                      before a socket will be destroyed.  [number] [default: 5000]

  -a, Number of accounts [number] [default: 10]
  -e, Number of ether per account [number] [default: 100]

  --account            Account data in the form '<private_key>,<initial_balance>', 
                       can be specified multiple times. Note that private keys are 64 characters long 
                       and must be entered as an 0x-prefixed hex string. Balance can either be input 
                       as an integer, or as a 0x-prefixed hex string with either form specifying the 
                       initial balance in wei.  [array]

  --account_keys_path  Saves generated accounts and private keys as JSON object in specified file  [string] [default: null]
  -n, --secure         Lock available accounts by default (good for third party transaction signing)  [boolean] [default: false]
  -u, --unlock         Comma-separated list of accounts or indices to unlock  [array]
  --hdPath, --hd_path  The hierarchical deterministic path to use when generating accounts. Default: "m/44'/60'/0'/0/"  [string]

Chain:
  -k, --hardfork      Pick a hardfork to use `byzantium`, `constantinople`, `petersburg`, `istanbul` and `muirGlacier` (default) [string] 

  -f, --fork          Fork from another currently running Ethereum client at a given block. Input should be the HTTP location and port of the other client, e.g. 'http://localhost:8545' or optionally provide a block number 'http://localhost:8545@1599200'  [string] [default: false]

  --forkCacheSize     The maximum size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache for queries on a chain fork. Defaults to `1_073_741_824` bytes (1 gigabyte). You can set this to `0` to disable caching (not recommended), or to `-1` for unlimited (will be limited by your node process).  [number] [default: 1073741824]

  --db                Directory of chain database; creates one if it doesn't exist  [string] [default: null]

  -s, --seed          Arbitrary data to generate the HD wallet mnemonic to be used  [string] [default: Random value, unless -d is specified]

  -d, --deterministic           Generate deterministic addresses based on a pre-defined mnemonic.  [boolean]

  -m, --mnemonic                bip39 mnemonic phrase for generating a PRNG seed, which is in turn used for hierarchical deterministic (HD) account generation  [string]

  --noVMErrorsOnRPCResponse     Do not transmit transaction failures as RPC errors. Enable this flag for error reporting behaviour which is compatible with other clients such as geth and Parity.  [boolean] [default: false]

  -b, --blockTime               Block time in seconds for automatic mining. Will instantly mine a new block for every transaction if option omitted. Avoid using unless your test cases require a specific mining interval.  [number]

  -i, --networkId               The Network ID ganache-cli will use to identify itself.  [number] [default: System time at process start or Network ID of forked blockchain if configured.]

  --chainId                     The Chain ID ganache-cli will use for `eth_chainId` RPC and the `CHAINID` opcode.  [number] [default: For legacy reasons, the default is currently `1337` for `eth_chainId` RPC and `1` for the `CHAINID` opcode. This will be fixed in the next major version of ganache-cli and ganache-core!]

  -g, --gasPrice                The price of gas in wei  [number] [default: 20000000000]

  -l, --gasLimit                The block gas limit in wei  [number] [default: 6721975]
  
  --callGasLimit                Sets the transaction gas limit for `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` calls. Must be specified as a hex string. Defaults to "0x1fffffffffffff" (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)  [number] [default: 9007199254740991]

  --allowUnlimitedContractSize  Allows unlimited contract sizes while debugging. By enabling this flag, the check within the EVM for contract size limit of 24KB (see EIP-170) is bypassed. Enabling this flag *will* cause ganache-cli to behave differently than production environments.  [boolean] [default: false]

  -t, --time                    Date (ISO 8601) that the first block should start. Use this feature, along with the evm_increaseTime method to test time-dependent code.  [string]

Other:
  --debug        Output VM opcodes for debugging  [boolean] [default: false]
  -v, --verbose  Log all requests and responses to stdout  [boolean] [default: false]
  --mem          Only show memory output, not tx history  [boolean] [default: false]
  -q, --quiet    Run ganache quietly (no logs)  [boolean] [default: false]

Options:
  --help, -?  Show help  [boolean]
  --version   Show version number  [boolean]
